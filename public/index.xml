      <description>Well Done Congratulations. You have completed this DevSecOps workshop on shifting security testing left.
Recap on what you have learned  Learned how to deploy CloudFormation stacks Learned about a modern CI/CD pipeline Learned how to test in AWS CodeBuild Learned about a couple of open source tools for security testing Learned why it is important to test as early as possible in the pipeline  Final Thoughts Due to the time and scope of the workshop there are several things that can and should be instrumented to improve security testing within the CI/CD pipeline.</description>

      <description>Your account must have the ability to create new IAM roles and scope other IAM permissions.
 If you already have an AWS account, and have IAM Administrator access, you can skip this page.
  If you don&amp;rsquo;t already have an AWS account with Administrator access: create one now
 Once you have an AWS account, ensure you are following the remaining workshop steps as an IAM user with administrator access to the AWS account: Create a new IAM user to use for the workshop</description>

      <description>You are responsible for the cost of the AWS services used while running this workshop in your AWS account.
 In order for you to succeed in this workshop, you will need to run through a few steps in order to properly setup and configure your environment. These steps will include provisioning some services, installing some tools, and downloading some dependencies as well. We will begin with AWS Cloud9. Technically, you should be able to complete many of the steps in these modules if you have a properly configured terminal.</description>

      <title>Setup Basic Services</title>

      <description>Introduction Up until now, we have been going through various steps to setup our environment. Installing tools and other necessary steps to make sure we progress through the modules without any issues. Now, we are ready to begin deploying the infrastructure that will support our Unicorn Store application.
Basic Services CloudFormation Stack We are going to setup some basic services such as an AWS CodeCommit and Amazon ECR services.</description>

      <description>Snyk Security Expected Outcome  Install Snyk Test open source dependencies of the Petstore application, have it fail, remediate security issue, and then have it pass. Test a docker image for security vulnerabilities  Lab Requirements: Automation lab must be completed
Average Lab Time: 30 minutes
Introduction This module is designed to introduce scanning open source dependencies of the application and the Docker container that is created during this workshop.</description>

      <title>Build &amp; Push to Repo</title>

      <guid>http://localhost/30_workshop_app_ci_cd/10_push_to_repo.html</guid>
      <description>Build &amp;amp; Push to AWS CodeCommit We should now be ready to push our application to the AWS CodeCommit repo and the Amazon Elastic Container Repository
The following sets a new origin for the application repo to CodeCommit unicorn-store, configures a credential helper needed for CodeCommit, and pushes the source code to the repo. This step is necessary for an automated pipeline as CodeBuild will build the application directly from this repo.</description>

      <description>Cleanup In order to prevent charges to your account we recommend cleaning up the infrastructure that was created. If you plan to keep things running so you can examine the workshop a bit more please remember to do the cleanup when you are done. It is very easy to leave things running in an AWS account, forget about it, and then accrue charges.
You will need to manually delete some resources before you delete the CloudFormation stacks so please do the following steps in order.</description>

      <title>Deploy ECS Fargate Service</title>
      <link>http://localhost/30_workshop_app_ci_cd/20_ecs_fargate.html</link>

      <guid>http://localhost/30_workshop_app_ci_cd/20_ecs_fargate.html</guid>
      <description>Deploy Fargate Service In the following set of commands we are going to use CloudFormation to deploy services that will allow our Unicorn Store application to service traffic from the Internet. The CloudFormation template sets up an ECS Cluster, a Service, Task Definition, Task, and Application Load Balancer.
cd ~/environment/modernization-workshop/modules/30_workshop_app aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name WorkshopECS --template-body file://ecs-fargate.yaml --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM until [[ `aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name &amp;#34;WorkshopECS&amp;#34; --query &amp;#34;Stacks[0].[StackStatus]&amp;#34; --output text` == &amp;#34;CREATE_COMPLETE&amp;#34; ]]; do echo &amp;#34;The stack is NOT in a state of CREATE_COMPLETE at `date`&amp;#34;; sleep 30; done &amp;amp;&amp;amp; echo &amp;#34;The Stack is built at `date` - Please proceed&amp;#34; This step takes approximately 3 minutes and if successfully, you should see the message as below.</description>

      <title>Deploy CI/CD Pipeline</title>

      <description>What is CI/CD? Continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) embodies a culture, set of operating principles, and collection of practices that enable application development teams to deliver features and functionality more frequently and reliably.
Continuous integration is a coding philosophy and set of practices that drive development teams to implement small changes and check in code to version control repositories as frequently as possible. Because most modern applications require developing code in different platforms and tools, the team needs a mechanism to integrate and validate its changes.</description>
