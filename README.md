# Snyk AWS Workshop

This workshop shows some examples of how you can include security in your modern software development lifecycle (SDLC) along with AWS services. You will learn to spin up a containerized web application on AWS and to use the AWS build tooling paired with Snyk in order to shift left in your SDLC.
